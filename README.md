# Academic & Scientific Portfolio | Odhisea Gazeli

Welcome to the repository of my personal academic portfolio, designed as an interactive, clean, magazine-style digital showcase. This site highlights my research, teaching materials, scientific projects, and technical methodology in **Plasma Physics**, **Photonics**, and **Analytical Chemistry**.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This portfolio is built with a modular, semantic approach. It avoids heavy front-end frameworks to maintain lightweight rendering and high compatibility across modern browsers, relying on clean HTML5, responsive CSS layouts, and vanilla JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Key Sections & Pages

- **Interactive Cover (`index.html`):** The landing page of the portfolio, styled as a minimal, high-end editorial journal cover.
- **Academic CV (`pages/cv.html`):** Detail-oriented overview of academic milestones, core laboratory diagnostics competencies, and instrument maintenance experience.
- **Digital Bookshelf (`pages/library.html`):** A thematic index cataloging reference textbooks in Physics, Mathematics, Photonics, Analytical Chemistry, and Computation.
- **Focus Time (`pages/clock.html`):** A fully functional digital watch styled after a classic Casio dial. It features three operational states:
  - **CLOCK:** Synced with system time.
  - **STOPWATCH:** Standard timer measuring minutes, seconds, and centiseconds.
  - **COUNTDOWN:** User-set countdown timer triggering a synchronized audio/visual alarm using the native *Web Audio API*.
- **Sketchbook (`pages/sketchbook.html`):** An interactive showcase displaying original physical and digital illustrations with dynamic hover transitions.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & SVG:** Semantic markup and crisp vector design (including the Casio clock interface).
- **CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, & CSS Variables):** For responsive alignment, asymmetric magazine-style layouts, and coordinate-driven designs (e.g., the blue bezel accent lines and backlight illuminations).
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Handles layout state toggles, interactive triggers, time loops, and Web Audio beep generation without relying on bloated external packages.
- **Google Fonts:** Integration of *Inter* (sans-serif), *Playfair Display* (serif headings), and *Share Tech Mono* (for the 7-segment digital LCD digits).

## 🚀 Deployment & Local Development

### Local Execution
This portfolio is a fully static website. To test it locally:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OdyGaz/OdyGaz.github.io.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in any standard web browser.

### Hosting
The site is hosted publicly via GitHub Pages. The `.nojekyll` file at the root ensures that static directories starting with underscores (should any Jekyl-specific configurations try to interfere) are loaded cleanly without server-side preprocessing.
